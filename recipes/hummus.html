    <p>You like hummus? This is a recipe i discovered while watching "Corvette Summer." I suggest watching this while eating, <strong>NOT</strong> while preparing. Injuries may result. Let's Go! </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><ul>
    <li>8 ounces (227g) dried chickpeas* (1 cup + 2 tbsp)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda, divided</li>
    <li>A generous ¾ cup (175-195g) good-quality tahini</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped**</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>6 to 10 tablespoons ice water</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fried Garlic-Lemon Topping <em>(Optional)</em></h3>
<ul>
    <li>⅓ cup (80 mL) good-quality extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>5 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 to 6 strips of lemon peel, about 2 inches long (don't peel too deeply to avoid the white pith)</li>
    <li>▢Flaky sea salt or kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Topping Options</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 handful of flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
    <li>Paprika, sumac, or Aleppo pepper flakes</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Soak the chickpeas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the chickpeas to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover with cold water and ½ teaspoon baking soda.</li>
        <li>Soak for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Cook the chickpeas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the drained chickpeas to a medium saucepan with ½ teaspoon baking soda and 6 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover the pot, and reduce the heat as needed to maintain a rapid simmer and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover the pot and add 1 teaspoon of kosher salt. Continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the chickpeas are very soft and smush when pressed with a spoon/fork or pressed between your fingers. Drain well.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Drain the chickpeas</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Transfer to a food processor. </li>
        <li>Blend for 1-2 minutes until you have a smooth puree, scraping down the sides as you go.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>To the food processor:</h3>
    <ul><li>Add:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>¾ cup tahini</li>
        <li> lemon juice</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>cumin</li>
        <li>1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>pepper to taste</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li><p>Blend-and with the motor running, stream in the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. After 6 tablespoons of ice water, evaluate the texture. If you want it to be looser, stream in more water, and continue blending until smooth and creamy. Once you reach your desired texture, taste for seasonings, adding more salt, garlic, cumin, or lemon juice as needed.</p></li></ul>
<li><h3>Make the topping.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium frying pan over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Once the oil is warm (but not too hot), add the garlic and cook, swirling the pan or stirring frequently, for 2 to 2 ½ minutes, until the garlic just turns golden (don't wait until it browns).</li>
<li>Add the lemon zest and cook for another 30 seconds. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the garlic and lemon zest to a plate and sprinkle with a bit of flaky sea salt. Reserve the oil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Transfer the hummus to a large plate</h3>
<ul><li>Use the back of a spoon to make waves or to make a well in the center.</li>
<li>Spoon the garlic-lemon oil into the ridges or into the well.</li>
<li>Top with the fried garlic and lemon zest. Top with chopped parsley and a few shakes of paprika</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h3>EAT!</h3></li>

</ol>
